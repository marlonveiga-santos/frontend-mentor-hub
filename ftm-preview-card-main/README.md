## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Good use of semantic HTML tags, avoid layout breaks. Te use of content after element and CSS3 attributes.

### Continued development

Learn mobile first principles and more useful content to not stay lost when alone with toxic teams.

### Useful resources
