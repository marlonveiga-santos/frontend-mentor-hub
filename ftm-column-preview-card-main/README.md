## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to use Grid and Flexbox together and how you can avoid the overuse of classes adding styles directly on HTML elements, combining your relationship to match specificity.

### Continued development

The total lack of class makes the style a little confusing but can help in specific cases where the framework overload the document CSS size. Next step will be testing this approach with one simple SASS file.
